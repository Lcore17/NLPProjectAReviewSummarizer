## üéØ Project Abstract
The **Review Summarization** project aims to automatically summarize customer reviews by identifying critical aspects such as **product quality, shipping, service, pricing, and overall sentiment.** This task involves applying advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, including tokenization, vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec), and deep learning models like **LSTM and BERT**.

The project explores and compares the performance of various approaches such as traditional ML models, deep learning architectures, and pre-trained transformer-based models fine-tuned for review summarization. The objective is to identify the most effective model that provides concise and accurate summaries, ensuring improved customer insights and enabling businesses to refine their services.
